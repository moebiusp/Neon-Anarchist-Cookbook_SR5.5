## Playing by Rules as Written <a id="docs-internal-guid-84f3036b-7fff-cef0-97a3-4fe74f5ee38e"></a>

The Neon Anarchist Cookbook is designed primarily for use in Neon Anarchy and has some house ruled entries. But can be just as easily used anywhere else including your own home games. Most entries will translate 1:1 with Rules as Written \(RAW\) but Neon Anarchy does not use Exotic Weapon Skills, instead using its own home brewed skills. When playing by RAW, any entry that has the following skills should use Exotic Weapon Skill \(Weapon Name\) instead of whatever skill name is mentioned. These skills are:  
Atypical Melee \(shields, skateboards, etc\), Directed Energy \(ranged energy weapons like Lasers\), Flexile Melee \(whip like weapons\) and Spray Weapons \(flamethrowers and sprayers\).
