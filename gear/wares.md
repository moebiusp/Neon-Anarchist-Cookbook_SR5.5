## Cyberware

### BODYWARE

#### ANGEL SYSTEM

\[APPROVED 3.0\]

Created by top brass in Ares, the Anti-Gravity Emergency Landing \(AnGEL\) System is the most futuristic piece of augmentation to come out of the AAA in years, utilizing similar tech as the Anti-Gravity Grenade \(SL 65\). Before Ares could cash in, the technology was stolen during a Shadowrun and leaked to the public. Even when the AAA clamped down hard to remove the tech from the market, the schematics were already in the hands of the underworld and shadow community who wasted no time in manufacturing their own versions, as a result of which KE was quick to make the augmentation illegal.  


This bodyware is implanted in the subject’s torso, or more preferably, a Cyber Torso. The AnGEL system is too big to fit anywhere else, including cyberlimbs. While unencumbered, , the user can activate the augmentation when falling as a Simple Action or as a -5 initiative Interrupt Action. When activated, the implant creates a spherical field of reduced gravity around the user, which is visually obvious as a spherical field of distortion, causing small things around it to float.. The effect lasts for 1 Combat Turn \(3 seconds\) per use. The user can fall up to 50 meters per use, without taking any Falling Damage \(SR5 172\). The AnGEL System comes with an internal battery that can hold three charges. Each use of the AnGEL System consumes one charge. The battery itself is cutting edge tech, using microparticles made from rare earth metals. The battery regains one charge per hour when plugged in to a power source.  


Wireless: The AnGEL System recharges by induction, regaining one charge per six hours of wireless-enabled time.

### CYBERLIMBS

#### CYBER MANIPULATOR

For decades now, cybertech designers were trying to answer the almost ancient demands for extra arms. One thing has been always, obviously, standing in the way:the lack of nerve connections to plug a cyberarm into. Eventually,  science figured out a solution —if there are no dedicated nerves to plug into, why not make your own? And so it happened. The Cyber Manipulators require the user to possess a Datajack and use it to read the user's inputs and then transfer them through artificial nerve connections. They can technically be mounted anywhere on the recipient's body, as long as the location is relatively close to the spine. They can take a multitude of shapes, but regular cyberarms and tentacle-like manipulators are the most popular.  


Cyber Manipulators count as full cyberlimbs \(and thus have a base STR and AGI of 3 each\) but they do not provide extra Physical condition monitor boxes like cyberlimbs usually do. They can take any cyberlimb enhancements and accessories, as well as cyberimplant weapons, except Armor \(SR5 457\). Each Cyber Manipulator lowers your Social Limit by 1. You can have a maximum of 4 Cyber Manipulators, any more and it overloads your nervous system. Cyber Manipulators are incompatible with Shiva Arms \(RF 118\) or any kind of Wings.

### CYBERLIMB ENHANCEMENTS

#### IMPACT PLATE

\[APPROVED 3.0\]

Impact plates are steel plates implanted into cyberlimbs, at points normally used for combat such as the end of fists, elbows, knees and feet. They can be installed in full or partial cyberarms and legs, as well as cyberhands and feet. Each cyberlimb can only have one impact plate. Each impact plate improves the AP of your unarmed damage by -1 and each pair of plates also increases your unarmed DV by 1; up to a maximum bonus DV of +2 and AP of -4. Impact plates must be installed in cyberlimbs and cannot be implanted directly into flesh. They count as cyberlimb enhancements, not implanted weapons, as they modify base unarmed damage. Impact plates are incompatible with Bone Lacing \(SR5 454\), Bone Density \(SR5 459\) or Striking Callus \(CF 121\) and doesn’t stack with Critical Strike \(SR5 309\) or Penetrating Strike \(SG 173\) adept powers.  


* “Does it make cyberlimbs even cooler now? Yes. Does it make me wish I’d have chopped off my arms and gotten cyberlimbs? No.” - Jawbreaker
* “Pro tip for people getting these and similar implants. Have your sparring partner wear safety gear, unless you enjoy paying for other people's hospital visits.” - Ugly

### HEADWARE

#### CEREBRETRON

\[APPROVED 3.0\]

The metahuman brain excels at certain areas of cognition, but falls woefully short in others. The practices of cyberware neural interfacing and implantation of commlinks are nothing new. The integration between thought processes and machine computation has, however, been at a relatively shallow level, until now. Cerebretron is a dedicated mental coprocessing computer implanted on the inner side of the skull or into a cyberskull. Comprehensively connected to many significant areas of the brain, such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, information processing tasks and memory recollection can be delegated to the computer by the brain. Add Cerebretron’s Rating to your Mental Limit as well as a dice pool bonus to your Knowledge, Language, and Memory tests \(SR5 152\). Cerebretron is incompatible with Mnemonic Enhancers \(SR5 460\).  


Wireless: Cerebretron expands its processing capability through the Matrix and uses heuristic algorithms in its influencing of thought processes to the point where it increases the overall capability of the user's brain. Select one of the four mental attributes per rating of Cerebretron \(LOG, INT, CHA or WIL\). Each of the selected attributes is augmented by 1. You can reconfigure your selection\(s\) as a Complex Action at any time. At Rating 4 all four of your mental attributes are augmented by 1 each. Cerebretron has safeties that prevent it from killing the brain even when it takes Matrix damage. It isn't connected to any areas responsible for motor control or the body's autonomous systems, so it can't be hacked to disrupt these functions.

#### COMPUTER ASSISTED POLYGRAPH INTEGRATION

\[APPROVED 3.0\]

The CAPI is a computer with sensors that can analyze minute cues in facial expressions, body language and voice of a target. It then cross-checks them with thousands of psychological profiles and case studies that have been stored in its memory to inform the user of the target’s state of mind. Add CAPI’s rating to your Social Limit as well as a dice pool bonus on Judge Intentions tests \(SR5 152\). With CAPI’s help, you can use Judge Intentions to oppose any Con skill tests instead of having to use Con.

#### IMPLANTED RCC 

\[APPROVED 3.0\]

Simply put, it's a Rigger Command Console that has been miniaturized and implanted into the body. Great for riggers who don’t want to lug around a briefcase.

### EYEWARE

#### TARGET PREDICTOR

The Target Predictor augments a Take Aim action \(SR5 166\), allowing you to reduce penalties from the Situational Modifiers Table \(SR5 176\) that are not Called Shots, by a total of 3 \(in addition to standard benefits of take aim\). This would apply to the next attack you make with the weapon you aimed with. Target Predictor is incompatible with Adept Centering \(SR5 325\) or Heightened Concern \(SSP 23\) Adept power.

#### T-RAY RECOGNIZER OVERLAY

\[APPROVED 4.0\]  
While it's toggled on, you can see wireless on devices and devices emitting electromagnetic rays in the invisible spectrum, as bright lights, as long as you're within 30m of those devices. The lights become fainter at longer ranges, but can still be detected up to 60m. Wireless on devices can be detected through most barriers as long as the barrier is thin enough so that wireless signals can pass through them.

## Bioware

### CULTURED BIOWARE

#### NEURAL HARDENING 

\[APPROVED 3.0\]

An up-and-coming bioware that myelinates neurons with synthetic sheaths that make the signalling system more robust and resistant to pain, fatigue, etc. The user’s stun condition monitor gains a number of extra boxes equal to the rating of the bioware.

#### SECONDARY HEART

This implants an additional synthetic heart with reinforced actin and myosin. The new heart is connected to all the major arteries and veins, providing the body with boosted circulation and a backup in case the primary heart fails for one of many reasons. Each rating of Secondary Heart increases the user's Body attribute by 1. In addition, the implant gives 1 extra damage box to your Physical Condition Monitor per rating of Secondary Heart. These extra boxes do not stack with those obtained from Cyberlimbs. You must choose one or the other.

## Nanoware

### HARD NANOWARE

#### TISSUE REPAIR SYSTEM

This Nanoware system circulates through the bloodstream, seeking out damaged tissues and repairing them. Each nanomachine acts as a submicroscopic surgeon, equipped with a variety of tools to repair the cellular matrix. Every 60 seconds, the nanomachines will scan your body for new physical injuries, then attempt to heal them. If the nanomachines fail to fully heal your current set of injuries, it cannot heal them again, instead continuing to scan for new injuries.  


While you have sustained damage to your physical condition monitor, Tissue Repair System will try to heal you every minute, with a dice pool equal to its Rating x 2 and a limit equal to its Rating. Every hit heals a box of their physical condition monitor. Tissue Repair System ignores all modifiers from the Healing Modifiers table \(SR5 208\) and does not need to meet a minimum threshold of 2 before it can start healing.  


This healing may only be applied to a character once for that set of wounds, but the nanomachines will continue to heal new physical wounds. If the character is in Physical overflow, Tissue Repair System stops working till they have been stabilized first. Healing from Tissue Repair System is incompatible with First Aid or Magical Healing already applied to the Physical Condition Monitor.

### NANOCYBERNETICS

#### MICRO MANIPULATOR 

\[APPROVED 3.0\]

This is a miniature nanohive implanted in a finger. It sends nanites to the fingertip to form a little dot's worth of nanites there, and also elsewhere on the finger to clean microcontaminants off of it. When you hold the dot within about a millimeter of the surface, or touch it directly \(as much as "touching" is defined in the nanoscale\), the nanites scan the surface in excruciating detail, letting you "read" things engraved in a microscale. The nanites can also etch or otherwise manipulate the surface on a nanoscale.  


With this implant, if anyone still used hard disk drives, you could touch the platter with your fingertip to literally flip single bits on the surface using nanites. Due to the cleaning function, it also prevents you from leaving fingerprints of the applied finger\(usually the dominant index finger.\) A Micro Manipulator grants +1 die and limit to Hardware tests.
